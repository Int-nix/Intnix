      <h3>What is Intnix?</h3>
      <p>Intnix is a web-based operating system built entirely in the browser. It offers terminal access, a multi-user file system, draggable desktop windows, app launching, scripting, and more — all without requiring downloads or installations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Why Intnix Exists</h3>
      <p>Modern computing has become bloated and closed. Intnix aims to reclaim the creative, hackable, personal spirit of software by giving users a fully programmable system in their browser. It’s fast, customizable, and made for creators.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>✔️ Terminal with custom command system</li>
        <li>✔️ Multi-user support & file system</li>
        <li>✔️ GUI apps with draggable windows</li>
        <li>✔️ Visual scripting with `.oos` language</li>
        <li>✔️ Built-in package manager & app store</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Who Made It?</h3>
      <p>Intnix was developed by a solo creator passionate about freedom in software. Built from scratch while balancing university exams, it’s designed to empower individuals — not corporations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Future Vision</h3>
      <p>Intnix is more than an OS — it’s a platform for creators to design, distribute, and run their own tools. With support for scripting, apps, automation, and even monetization through ads, the goal is to make powerful computing truly accessible.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="section">
  <h3>Modular by Design</h3>
  <p>Intnix is built on a modular architecture where every component — from the terminal to the desktop to the app system — can be extended or replaced. Developers can add commands, build apps, and interact with the OS via bridges and scripting without needing external tools.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Built for the Browser</h3>
  <p>Unlike traditional operating systems, Intnix runs entirely in the browser. There’s no setup, no installation, and no operating system restrictions — just open a tab and boot into your workspace. It even supports running full apps, saving files, and loading packages within the browser’s sandbox.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Creator-Centered Philosophy</h3>
  <p>Intnix is a response to the growing corporatization of software. It empowers individual creators to take back control over their computing environment. Whether you're designing tools, building interfaces, or writing scripts, Intnix puts you in charge.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>Lightweight but Powerful</h3>
  <p>Despite being browser-based, Intnix packs serious functionality. From a command-driven core to visual scripting and real-time file operations, it delivers performance without bloat. Even low-end devices can run a full operating environment in seconds.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h3>A Vision Beyond the OS</h3>
  <p>Intnix is more than just an operating system. It's a movement — a platform for postmodern computing that blends art, technology, and individual freedom. Its long-term vision includes an ecosystem of apps, creators, monetization models, and tools that redefine what software can be.</p>
